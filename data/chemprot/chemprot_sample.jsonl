{"sentence": "Probing the salmeterol binding site on the beta 2-adrenergic receptor using a novel photoaffinity ligand, [(125)I]iodoazidosalmeterol.\nSalmeterol is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) agonist used clinically to treat asthma. In addition to binding at the active agonist site, it has been proposed that salmeterol also binds with very high affinity at a second site, termed the \"exosite\", and that this exosite contributes to the long duration of action of salmeterol. To determine the position of the phenyl ring of the aralkyloxyalkyl side chain of salmeterol in the beta 2AR binding site, we designed and synthesized the agonist photoaffinity label [(125)I]iodoazidosalmeterol ([125I]IAS). In direct adenylyl cyclase activation, in effects on adenylyl cyclase after pretreatment of intact cells, and in guinea pig tracheal relaxation assays, IAS and the parent drug salmeterol behave essentially the same. Significantly, the photoreactive azide of IAS is positioned on the phenyl ring at the end of the molecule which is thought to be involved in exosite binding. Carrier-free radioiodinated [125I]IAS was used to photolabel epitope-tagged human beta 2AR in membranes prepared from stably transfected HEK 293 cells. Labeling with [(125)I]IAS was blocked by 10 microM (-)-alprenolol and inhibited by addition of GTP gamma S, and [125I]IAS migrated at the same position on an SDS-PAGE gel as the beta 2AR labeled by the antagonist photoaffinity label [125I]iodoazidobenzylpindolol ([125I]IABP). The labeled receptor was purified on a nickel affinity column and cleaved with factor Xa protease at a specific sequence in the large loop between transmembrane segments 5 and 6, yielding two peptides. While the control antagonist photoaffinity label [125I]IABP labeled both the large N-terminal fragment [containing transmembranes (TMs) 1-5] and the smaller C-terminal fragment (containing TMs 6 and 7), essentially all of the [125I]IAS labeling was on the smaller C-terminal peptide containing TMs 6 and 7. This direct biochemical evidence demonstrates that when salmeterol binds to the receptor, its hydrophobic aryloxyalkyl tail is positioned near TM 6 and/or TM 7.

{"sentence": "Induction of multidrug resistance transporter ABCG2 by prolactin in human breast cancer cells.\nThe multidrug transporter, breast cancer resistance protein, ABCG2, is up-regulated in certain chemoresistant cancer cells and in the mammary gland during lactation. We investigated the role of the lactogenic hormone prolactin (PRL) in the regulation of ABCG2. PRL dose-dependently induced ABCG2 expression in T-47D human breast cancer cells. This induction was significantly reduced by short-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). Knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of the down-stream signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5) also blunted the induction of ABCG2 by PRL, suggesting a role for the JAK2/STAT5 pathway in PRL-induced ABCG2 expression. Corroborating these findings, we observed PRL-stimulated STAT5 recruitment to a region containing a putative \u03b3-interferon activation sequence (GAS) element at -434 base pairs upstream of the ABCG2 transcription start site. Introduction of a single mutation to the -434 GAS element significantly attenuated PRL-stimulated activity of a luciferase reporter driven by the ABCG2 gene promoter and 5'-flanking region containing the -434 GAS motif. In addition, this GAS element showed strong copy number dependency in its response to PRL treatment. Interestingly, inhibitors against the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling pathways significantly decreased the induction of ABCG2 by PRL without altering STAT5 recruitment to the GAS element. We conclude that the JAK2/STAT5 pathway is required but not sufficient for the induction of ABCG2 by PRL.", "lin_triplets": ""}

In this study, we evaluated the toxic potential of these drugs at the therapeutic doses in female Wistar rats. Animals were randomly divided into four groups: those administered 1% Tween 80 (control), those administered artemether (4\u00a0mg/kg body weight), those administered lumefantrine (24\u00a0mg/kg body weight), and those coadministered artemether (4\u00a0mg/kg body weight) and lumefantrine (24\u00a0mg/kg body weight). The drugs were orally administered twice daily for 3 days by gastric intubation after which selected plasma biochemical indices, and erythrocytes antioxidant defence and lipid peroxidation markers were evaluated. Coadministration of artemether and lumefantrine raised liver and renal function markers and increased atherogenic index. While reduced glutathione, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and catalase activities were reduced, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-s-transferase activities increased in all the treated groups compared to the control group. The drugs caused significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels compared to the control group.

In total, 30 healthy women (range 40-60 years) were administered 400 mg of Polycalcium for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy parameter was urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPYR) levels, and serum osteocalcin (OSC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), urinary cross-linked C-telopeptide of type-1 collagen (CTx), urinary cross-linked N-telopeptide of type-1 collagen (NTx), calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P) levels, which were evaluated for comparison before and after administration of Polycalcium. After 4 weeks of Polycalcium administration, 27 subjects completed the test plan. Three subjects withdrew their consent to participate. The values of blood OSC, BALP, serum Ca, and serum P from baseline to 4 weeks of treatment were changed by -28.44%, 14.37%, 6.11%, and 1.42%, respectively.

{"sentence": "Establishment of an in vitro photoallergy test using NCTC2544 cells and IL-18 production.\nDifferentiation between photoallergenic and phototoxic reactions induced by low molecular weight compounds represents a current problem. The use of keratinocytes as a potential tool for the detection of photoallergens as opposed to photoirritants is considered an interesting strategy for developing in vitro methods. We have previously demonstrated the possibility to use the human keratinocyte cell line NCTC2455 and the production of interleukin-18 (IL-18) to screen low molecular weight sensitizers. The purpose of this work was to explore the possibility to use the NCTC2544 assay to identify photoallergens and discriminate from phototoxic chemicals. First, we identified suitable condition of UV-irradiation (3.5 J/cm(2)) by investigating the effect of UVA irradiation on intracellular IL-18 on untreated or chloropromazine (a representative phototoxic compound)-treated NCTC2544 cells. Then, the effect of UVA-irradiation over NCTC2544 cells treated with increasing concentrations of 15 compounds including photoallergens (benzophenone, 4-ter-butyl-4-methoxy-dibenzoylmethane, 2-ethylexyl-p-methoxycinnamate, ketoprofen, 6-methylcumarin); photoirritant and photoallergen (4-aminobenzoic acid, chlorpromazine, promethazine); photoirritants (acridine, ibuprofen, 8-methoxypsoralen, retinoic acid); and negative compounds (lactic acid, SDS and p-phenilendiamine) was investigated. Twenty-four hours after exposure, cytotoxicity was evaluated by the MTT assay or LDH leakage, while ELISA was used to measure the production of IL-18. At the maximal concentration assayed with non-cytotoxic effects (CV80 under irradiated condition), all tested photoallergens induced a significant and a dose-dependent increase of intracellular IL-18 following UVA irratiation, whereas photoirritants failed.

{"sentence": "Apomorphine is a bimodal modulator of TRPA1 channels.\nApomorphine is a non-narcotic derivative of morphine, which acts as a dopamine agonist and is clinically used to treat \"off-states\" in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. Adverse effects of apomorphine treatment include severe emesis and nausea, and ulceration and pain at the injection site. We wanted to test whether sensory transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a molecular target for apomorphine. Here, we show that rTRPV1, rTRPV2, rTRPV3, and mTRPV4, as well as hTRPM8, and rTRPM3, which are expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons, are insensitive toward apomorphine treatment. This also applied to the cellular redox sensor hTRPM2. On the contrary, human TRPA1 could be concentration-dependently modulated by apomorphine. Whereas the addition of apomorphine in the low micromolar range produced an irreversible activation of the channel, application of higher concentrations caused a reversible voltage-dependent inhibition of heterologously expressed TRPA1 channels, resulting from a reduction of single-channel open times. In addition, we provide evidence that apomorphine also acts on endogenous TRPA1 in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons from rats and in the enterochromaffin model cell line QGP-1, from which serotonin is released upon activation of TRPA1.

{"sentence": "Oxidative stress induces differential gene expression in a human lens epithelial cell line.\nPURPOSE: To identify differentially expressed genes in a human lens epithelial cell line exposed to oxidative stress. METHODS: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) differential display was used to evaluate differential gene expression in a human lens epithelial cell line (SRA 01-04) when cells were exposed for 3 hours to a single bolus of 200 microM hydrogen peroxide. Differentially expressed genes were identified through DNA sequencing and a nucleotide database search. Differential expression was confirmed by northern blot and RT-PCR analyses. RESULTS: Using 18 primer sets, 28 RT-PCR products were differentially expressed between control and hydrogen peroxide-treated cells. In stressed cells, mitochondrial transcripts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase subunit 4 and cytochrome b were downregulated 4-fold. Of the cytoplasmic mRNAs, glutamine cyclotransferase decreased 10-fold, whereas cytokine-inducible nuclear protein, alternative splicing factor 2, and beta-hydroxyisobutyryl-coenzyme A hydrolase increased 2-, 4-, and 10-fold, respectively. Analysis of mitochondrial transcripts in a 24-hour time course showed that NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 mRNA decreased by 2-fold as early as 1 hour after oxidative stress, whereas the rate of decrease was slower for cytochrome b, cytochrome oxidase III, and 16S rRNA.

To further validate the result, we examined sub-cellular distribution of c-Rel in lungs of CS-exposed guinea pigs treated or untreated with vitamin C.

A similar pattern of susceptibility is observed following acute exposure to the neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), and the resistance of TIDA neurons to MPTP is associated with increased expression of parkin and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L-1 (UCHL- 1). In the present study, the response of TIDA and NSDA neurons to acute MPTP administration following chronic MPTP exposure was examined. Mice were treated with ten injections of either MPTP (20 mg/kg; s.c.; every 3.5 days) or saline vehicle (10 ml/kg; s.c.; every 3.5 days). Following a 21 day recovery period, chronic saline- and MPTP-treated mice received an additional injection of either saline (10 ml/kg; s.c.) or MPTP (20 mg/kg; s.c.) and were sacrificed 24 h later. NSDA neurons displayed significant axon terminal degeneration (as indexed by decreases in DA, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and DA transporter concentrations in the striatum) as well as loss of TH-immunoreactive (IR) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) following MPTP, whereas TIDA neurons revealed no overt axon terminal pathology or loss of TH-IR cell bodies. NSDA neuronal pathology was associated with transient decreases in concentrations of parkin and UCHL-1 protein in the SN, which returned to normal levels by 21 days following cessation of chronic neurotoxicant exposure. Resistance of TIDA neurons to MPTP toxicity was correlated with a transient increase in UCHL-1 and a sustained elevation in parkin in the arcuate nucleus. TIDA neurons represent a DA neuron population with a unique and inherent ability to adapt to acute and chronic toxicant administration with a sustained elevation of the neuroprotective protein parkin. The correlation between the ability to increase parkin and UCHL-1 expression and the resistance of DA neurons to neurotoxicant exposure is consistent with a functional link between these features and an underlying differential susceptibility to toxicant-associated neurodegeneration.", "lin_triplets": "<triplet> MPTP <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> UCHL- 1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> UCHL- 1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> tyrosine hydroxylase <obj> Downregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Downregulator  <subj> DA transporter <obj> Downregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Downregulator  <subj> UCHL-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Not <triplet> 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> UCHL- 1 <obj> Upregulator <triplet> MPTP <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> UCHL- 1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> UCHL- 1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> tyrosine hydroxylase <obj> Downregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Downregulator  <subj> DA transporter <obj> Downregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Downregulator  <subj> UCHL-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Not <triplet> MPTP <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> UCHL- 1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> UCHL- 1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> tyrosine hydroxylase <obj> Downregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Downregulator  <subj> DA transporter <obj> Downregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Downregulator  <subj> UCHL-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Not <triplet> MPTP <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> UCHL- 1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> UCHL- 1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> tyrosine hydroxylase <obj> Downregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Downregulator  <subj> DA transporter <obj> Downregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Downregulator  <subj> UCHL-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Not <triplet> MPTP <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> UCHL- 1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> UCHL- 1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> tyrosine hydroxylase <obj> Downregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Downregulator  <subj> DA transporter <obj> Downregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Downregulator  <subj> UCHL-1 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> parkin <obj> Upregulator  <subj> TH <obj> Not"}

METHODS: The study involved 215 type 2 diabetes patients with nephropathy, 95 patients with diabetes duration > or =10 years, free of nephropathy, and 360 healthy subjects. All individuals were genotyped for the NET-8 gene polymorphism with the PCR-RFLP method. Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between the groups. NE was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection. RESULTS: We genotyped 310 patients and 360 controls for the NET gene polymorphism. Genotype distribution in both groups was in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There were no significant differences in the frequency of genotypes and alleles between patients and controls (p = 0.43). The frequencies were also similar for patients with nephropathy and those without. After dividing the patient group into hypertensive (n = 208) and normotensive (n = 102) subjects, there was a significant increase in the frequency of the AA genotype in patients with hypertension compared to normotensives (19 vs. 10%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: No association was found between G1287A polymorphism in the NET gene and diabetes. Our results suggest that this polymorphism has a possible role in increased susceptibility to hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes.", "lin_triplets": "<triplet> norepinephrine <subj> Norepinephrine transporter <obj> Substrate  <subj> NET <obj> Substrate <triplet> NE <subj> NET <obj> Substrate  <subj> Norepinephrine transporter <obj> Substrate  <subj> NE transporter <obj> Substrate <triplet> NE <subj> NET <obj> Substrate  <subj> Norepinephrine transporter <obj> Substrate  <subj> NE transporter <obj> Substrate"}
{"sentence": "Improved Insulin Sensitivity despite Increased Visceral Adiposity in Mice Deficient for the Immune Cell Transcription Factor T-bet.\nLow-grade inflammation in fat is associated with insulin resistance, although the mechanisms are unclear. We report that mice deficient in the immune cell transcription factor T-bet have lower energy expenditure and increased visceral fat compared with wild-type mice, yet paradoxically are more insulin sensitive. This striking phenotype, present in young T-bet(-/-) mice, persisted with high-fat diet and increasing host age and was associated with altered immune cell numbers and cytokine secretion specifically in visceral adipose tissue. However, the favorable metabolic phenotype observed in T-bet-deficient hosts was lost in T-bet(-/-) mice also lacking adaptive immunity (T-bet(-/-)xRag2(-/-)), demonstrating that T-bet expression in the adaptive rather than the innate immune system impacts host glucose homeostasis. Indeed, adoptive transfer of T-bet-deficient, but not wild-type, CD4(+) T\u00a0cells to Rag2(-/-) mice improved insulin sensitivity. Our results reveal a role for T-bet in metabolic physiology and obesity-associated insulin resistance.", "lin_triplets": ""}
{"sentence": "Enzyme-responsive surface erosion of poly(ethylene carbonate) for controlled drug release.\nCholesterol esterase (CE) induced surface erosion of poly(ethylene carbonate) (PEC) and drug release from PEC under mild physiological environment was investigated. The degradation process was monitored by changes of mass and molecular weight (MW) and surface morphology of polymer films. During the whole period of degradation, MW of PEC was unchanged. Water uptake of the polymer was only 2.8 and 0.2% for PEC with the MW of 200 kDa (PEC200) and PEC with the MW of 41 kDa (PEC41), respectively. Degradation of less hydrophilic PEC41 with higher density was slower than that of PEC200. By this mechanism, CE-responsive drug in vitro release from PEC in situ forming depots (ISFD) was conducted successfully. As expected, less bovine serum albumin (BSA) was released from PEC41 compared with that of PEC200 in the same time period. In conclusion, this work enabled the in vitro drug release evaluation of existing PEC devices and implied a new candidate for the development of enzyme-responsive systems.", "lin_triplets": ""}
{"sentence": "Accumulation of glutathione disulfide mediates NF-kappaB activation during immune stimulation with CpG DNA.\nInnate immune cells recognize pathogens by detecting molecular patterns that are distinct from those of the host. One such pattern is unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, which are common in bacterial DNA but not in vertebrate genomes. Macrophages respond to such CpG motifs in bacterial DNA or synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) by inducing NF-kappaB and secreting proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), but the mechanisms regulating this have been unclear. CpG ODN-stimulated cells produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and have a decreased ratio of intracellular glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG), indicating a shift to a more oxidized intracellular redox state. To determine whether this may play a role in mediating the CpG-induced macrophage activation, the GSH/GSSG redox state was manipulated in the murine macrophagelike cell line RAW264.7. Treatment of cells with BCNU to inhibit glutathione reductase (GR) enhanced the CpG-induced intracellular oxidation and decreased the GSH/GSSG, with increased activation of NF-kappaB and a doubling in the CpG-induced production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Experimental manipulation of the intracellular GSSG concentration during inhibition of cellular prooxidant production demonstrated that increased intracellular GSSG is a primary signal that is directly or indirectly required for CpG-induced NF-kappaB activation but is not in itself sufficient to trigger this in the absence of CpG ODN. These data suggest the existence of a second CpG-induced intracellular signal, independent of GSSG, mediating the activation of innate immunity by bacterial DNA.", "lin_triplets": "<triplet> glutathione disulfide <subj> NF-kappaB <obj> Upregulator <triplet> BCNU <subj> glutathione reductase <obj> Downregulator  <subj> GR <obj> Downregulator  <subj> NF-kappaB <obj> Upregulator  <subj> IL-6 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> TNF-alpha <obj> Upregulator <triplet> GSH <subj> NF-kappaB <obj> Downregulator  <subj> IL-6 <obj> Downregulator  <subj> TNF-alpha <obj> Downregulator <triplet> GSSG <subj> NF-kappaB <obj> Upregulator  <subj> NF-kappaB <obj> Upregulator  <subj> NF-kappaB <obj> Upregulator  <subj> IL-6 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> TNF-alpha <obj> Upregulator <triplet> GSSG <subj> NF-kappaB <obj> Upregulator  <subj> NF-kappaB <obj> Upregulator  <subj> NF-kappaB <obj> Upregulator  <subj> IL-6 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> TNF-alpha <obj> Upregulator <triplet> GSSG <subj> NF-kappaB <obj> Upregulator  <subj> NF-kappaB <obj> Upregulator  <subj> NF-kappaB <obj> Upregulator  <subj> IL-6 <obj> Upregulator  <subj> TNF-alpha <obj> Upregulator"}

{"sentence": "A 4-trifluoromethyl derivative of salicylate, triflusal, stimulates nitric oxide production by human neutrophils: role in platelet function.\nBACKGROUND: The thrombotic process is a multicellular phenomenon in which not only platelets but also neutrophils are involved. Recent in vitro studies performed in our laboratory have demonstrated that triflusal, a 4-trifluoromethyl derivative of salicylate, reduced platelet aggregation not only by inhibiting thromboxane A2 production but also by stimulating nitric oxide (NO) generation by neutrophils. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether oral treatment of healthy volunteers with triflusal could modify the ability of their neutrophils to produce NO and to test the role of the NO released by neutrophils in the modulation of ADP-induced platelet aggregation and alpha-granule secretion. METHODS: The study was performed in 12 healthy volunteers who were orally treated with triflusal (600 mg day-1) for 5 days. Flow cytometric detection of platelet surface expression of P-selectin was used as a measure of the ability of platelets to release the contents of their alpha-granules. RESULTS: After treatment with triflusal, there was an increase in NO production by neutrophils and an increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression in neutrophils. A potentiation of the inhibition of platelet aggregation by neutrophils was reversed by incubating neutrophils with both an L-arginine antagonist, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and an NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5 tetramethylimidazoline 1-oxyl 3-oxide (C-PTIO). A slight decrease in P-selectin surface expression on platelets was found which was not modified by the presence of neutrophils and therefore by the neutrophil-derived NO. Exogenous NO released by sodium nitroprusside dose-dependently inhibited both ADP-stimulated alpha-granule secretion and platelet aggregation. Therefore, platelet aggregation showed a greater sensitivity to be inhibited by exogenous NO than P-selectin expression. CONCLUSION: Oral treatment of healthy volunteers with triflusal stimulated NO production and eNOS protein expression in their neutrophils. After triflusal treatment, the neutrophils demonstrated a higher ability to prevent ADP-induced platelet aggregation. However, the neutrophils and the endogenous NO generated by them failed to modify P-selectin expression in ADP-activated platelets.", "lin_triplets": "<triplet> triflusal <subj> endothelial nitric oxide synthase <obj> Upregulator  <subj> eNOS <obj> Upregulator  <subj> eNOS <obj> Upregulator <triplet> NO <subj> P-selectin <obj> Not  <subj> P-selectin <obj> Not <triplet> triflusal <subj> endothelial nitric oxide synthase <obj> Upregulator  <subj> eNOS <obj> Upregulator  <subj> eNOS <obj> Upregulator <triplet> NO <subj> P-selectin <obj> Not  <subj> P-selectin <obj> Not"}

{"sentence": "Mechanism of iodide-dependent catalatic activity of thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase.\nMechanisms that have been proposed for peroxidase-catalyzed iodination require the utilization of 1 mol of H2O2 for organic binding of 1 mol of iodide. When we measured the stoichiometry of this reaction using thyroid peroxidase or lactoperoxidase at pH 7.0, we consistently obtained a ratio less than 1.0. This was shown to be attributable to catalase-like activity of these enzymes, resulting in unproductive cleavage of H2O2. This catalatic activity was completely iodide-dependent. To elucidate the mechanism of the iodide-dependent catalatic activity, the effects of various agents were investigated. The major observations may be summarized as follows: 1) The catalatic activity was inhibited in the presence of an iodine acceptor such as tyrosine. 2) The pseudohalide, SCN-, could not replace I- as a promoter of catalatic activity. 3) The inhibitory effects of the thioureylene drugs, methimazole and carbimazole, on the iodide-dependent catalatic activity were very similar to those reported previously for thyroid peroxidase-catalyzed iodination. 4) High concentrations of I- inhibited the catalatic activity of thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase in a manner similar to that described previously for peroxidase-catalyzed iodination. On the basis of these observations and other findings, we have proposed a scheme which offers a possible explanation for iodide-dependent catalatic activity of thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase. Compound I of the peroxidases is represented as EO, and oxidation of I- by EO is postulated to form enzyme-bound hypoiodite, represented in our scheme as [EOI]-. We suggest that the latter can react with H2O2 in a catalase-like reaction, with evolution of O2. We postulate further that the same form of oxidized iodine is also involved in iodination of tyrosine, oxidation of thioureylene drugs, and oxidation of I-, and that inhibition of catalatic activity by these agents occurs through competition with H2O2 for oxidized iodine.", "lin_triplets": "<triplet> iodide <subj> thyroid peroxidase <obj> Regulator  <subj> lactoperoxidase <obj> Regulator  <subj> peroxidase <obj> Substrate  <subj> thyroid peroxidase <obj> Regulator  <subj> lactoperoxidase <obj> Regulator <triplet> H2O2 <subj> peroxidase <obj> Cofactor  <subj> catalase <obj> Substrate  <subj> catalase <obj> Substrate <triplet> iodide <subj> thyroid peroxidase <obj> Regulator  <subj> lactoperoxidase <obj> Regulator  <subj> peroxidase <obj> Substrate  <subj> thyroid peroxidase <obj> Regulator  <subj> lactoperoxidase <obj> Regulator <triplet> H2O2 <subj> peroxidase <obj> Cofactor  <subj> catalase <obj> Substrate  <subj> catalase <obj> Substrate <triplet> thioureylene <subj> thyroid peroxidase <obj> Downregulator <triplet> methimazole <subj> thyroid peroxidase <obj> Downregulator <triplet> carbimazole <subj> thyroid peroxidase <obj> Downregulator <triplet> I- <subj> thyroid peroxidase <obj> Downregulator  <subj> lactoperoxidase <obj> Downregulator  <subj> peroxidase <obj> Downregulator  <subj> peroxidases <obj> Substrate  <subj> EO <obj> Substrate  <subj> EO <obj> Substrate <triplet> iodide <subj> thyroid peroxidase <obj> Regulator  <subj> lactoperoxidase <obj> Regulator  <subj> peroxidase <obj> Substrate  <subj> thyroid peroxidase <obj> Regulator  <subj> lactoperoxidase <obj> Regulator <triplet> I- <subj> thyroid peroxidase <obj> Downregulator  <subj> lactoperoxidase <obj> Downregulator  <subj> peroxidase <obj> Downregulator  <subj> peroxidases <obj> Substrate  <subj> EO <obj> Substrate  <subj> EO <obj> Substrate <triplet> hypoiodite <subj> EO <obj> Substrate  <subj> peroxidases <obj> Substrate  <subj> EO <obj> Substrate <triplet> EOI <subj> EO <obj> Substrate  <subj> EO <obj> Substrate  <subj> peroxidases <obj> Substrate <triplet> H2O2 <subj> peroxidase <obj> Cofactor  <subj> catalase <obj> Substrate  <subj> catalase <obj> Substrate <triplet> O2 <subj> catalase <obj> Substrate"}
{"sentence": "Lipotoxicity impairs incretin signalling.\nThe incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide are secreted by enteroendocrine cells and augment glucose-induced insulin secretion in response to food ingestion in a glucose-dependent manner. This mechanism forms the basis for incretin-based therapies in type 2 diabetes. However, the insulinotropic effect of incretins is diminished in type 2 diabetic patients, due in part to reduced expression of incretin receptors as a consequence of glucotoxicity. In this issue of Diabetologia, Kang et al (DOI: 10.1007/s00125-012-2776-x ) provide evidence that in addition to glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity also affects incretin receptor expression and signalling in insulin-secreting cells and isolated islets. In animal models of diabetes, the authors show that co-administration of a lipid-lowering drug with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist improved glucose tolerance and beta cell mass.

In pigeons trained to discriminate 1.7 mg/kg dezocine from saline, a series of opioids with activity at the mu opioid receptor substituted completely for the dezocine stimulus with a rank order of potency similar to that obtained in other assays sensitive to the effects of mu agonists (i.e., fentanyl >[-]-cyclazocine >buprenorphine = butorphanol >l-methadone >nalbuphine >[-]-metazocine >morphine). (-)-N-allylnormetazocine and (+)-propoxyphene substituted partially for the dezocine stimulus, an effect obtained even when tested up to doses that suppressed responding. Naloxone (0.1 - 10 mg/kg) antagonized the stimulus effects of dezocine, (+)-propoxyphene and fentanyl in a dose-related manner, whereas doses of naloxone that antagonized fentanyl's rate-decreasing effects failed to antagonize the rate-decreasing effects of dezocine and (+)-propoxyphene. A 10-mg/kg dose of the mu-selective, noncompetitive antagonist beta-funaltrexamine was more effective against the stimulus effects of dezocine and nalbuphine than against morphine and fentanyl. As was observed with naloxone, beta-funaltrexamine failed to antagonize dezocine's rate-decreasing effects.

Biochemically, they prevent posttranslational isoprenylation of small GTPases, thus inhibiting their activity. In tumor cells, activated RAS-GTPase, the founding member of the gene family, down-regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene FAS via epigenetic DNA-methylation by DNMT1. We compared ibandronate treatment in neoplastic human U-2 osteosarcoma and in mouse CCL-51 breast cancer cells as well as in the immortalized non-neoplastic MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. Ibandronate attenuated cell proliferation in all cell lines tested. In the neoplastic cells we found up-regulation of caspases suggesting apoptosis. Further we found stimulation of FAS-expression as a result of epigenetic DNA demethylation that was due to down-regulation of DNMT1, which was rescued by re-isoprenylation by both geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate and farnesylpyrophosphate. In contrast, ibandronate did not affect FAS and DNMT1 expression in MC3T3-E1 non-neoplastic cells. Data suggest that bisphosphonates via modulation of the activity of small-GTPases induce apoptosis in neoplastic cells by DNA-CpG-demethylation and stimulation of FAS-expression.

Increased activity of cortical 5-HT(2A) receptors has been associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety and schizophrenia. Here we examine the mechanisms involved in this enhanced ERK1/2 activation in rat PFCx and in a neuronal cell model. Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a non-selective cannabinoid agonist (CP55940, 50\u03bcg/kg, 7 days, i.p.) showed enhanced co-immunoprecipitation of \u03b2-Arrestin 2 and ERK1/2, enhanced pERK protein levels, and enhanced expression of \u03b2-Arrestin 2 mRNA and protein levels in PFCx. In a neuronal cell line, we found that selective CB(2) receptor agonists upregulate \u03b2-Arrestin 2, an effect that was prevented by selective CB(2) receptor antagonist JTE-907 and CB(2) shRNA lentiviral particles. Additionally, inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, ERK1/2, and the AP-1 transcription factor also prevented the cannabinoid receptor-induced upregulation of \u03b2-Arrestin 2. Our results suggest that sustained activation of CB(2) receptors would enhance \u03b2-Arrestin 2 expression possibly contributing to its increased interaction with ERK1/2, thereby driving the upregulation of 5-HT(2A) receptors. The CB(2) receptor-mediated upregulation of \u03b2-Arrestin 2 would be mediated, at least in part, by an ERK1/2-dependent activation of AP-1.

{"sentence": "Arsenic trioxide-induced hERG K(+) channel deficiency can be rescued by matrine and oxymatrine through up-regulating transcription factor Sp1 expression.\nThe human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the rapidly activating, delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr) important for cardiac repolarization. Dysfunction of the hERG channel can cause Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). A wide variety of structurally diverse therapeutic compounds reduce the hERG current by acute direct inhibition of the hERG current or/and selective disruption of hERG protein expression. Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), which is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia, can cause LQTS type 2 (LQT2) by reducing the hERG current through the diversion of hERG trafficking to the cytoplasmic membrane. This cardiotoxicity limits its clinical applications. Our aim was to develop cardioprotective agents to decrease As(2)O(3)-induced cardiotoxicity. We reported that superfusion of hERG-expressing HEK293 (hERG-HEK) cells with matrine (1, 10 \u03bcM) increased the hERG current by promoting hERG channel activation. Long-term treatment with 1 \u03bcM matrine or oxymatrine increased expression of the hERG protein and rescued the hERG surface expression disrupted by As(2)O(3). In addition, Matrine and oxymatrine significantly shortened action potential duration prolonged by As(2)O(3) in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. These results were ascribed to the up-regulation of hERG at both mRNA and protein levels via an increase in the expression of transcription factor Sp1, an established transactivator of the hERG gene.

It has been suggested that the affinity of these compounds for a site on the dopamine transporter, and not their local anesthetic actions, is responsible for these abuse-related behavioral effects. In the present study, three local anesthetics previously shown to be self-administered in animals were examined in squirrel monkeys trained to discriminate cocaine (0.3 mg/kg) from saline in a two-lever, food-reinforced procedure. Dimethocaine (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) fully and dose-dependently substituted for cocaine. Doses of dimethocaine (1.7 mg/kg) and cocaine (0.3 mg/kg) which produced full (> 80%) substitution for cocaine were administered in combination with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 39166 ((-)-trans-6,7,7a,8,9,13b-hexahydro-3-chloro-2-hydroxy-N-methyl-5H -benzo [d]naphtho-(2,1-b)azepine) and the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist raclopride (both at 0.003-0.03 mg/kg). SCH 39166 fully blocked the cocaine-like discriminative stimulus effects of dimethocaine and cocaine, but raclopride produced only partial antagonism of cocaine-lever selection. In addition, there was some evidence that raclopride blocked cocaine-lever responding produced by a lower dose of dimethocaine. In substitution studies, neither procaine (1-10 mg/kg) nor chloroprocaine (1-30 mg/kg) produced cocaine-like effects.

{"sentence": "Intracellular K+ is required for the inactivation-induced high-affinity binding of cisapride to HERG channels.\nMany commonly used medications can cause long QT syndrome and thus increase the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. High-affinity human Ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channel blockade by structurally diverse compounds is almost exclusively responsible for this side effect. Understanding drug-HERG channel interactions is an important step in avoiding drug-induced long QT syndromes. Previous studies have found that disrupting HERG inactivation reduces the degree of drug block and have suggested that the inactivated state is the preferential state for drug binding to HERG channels. However, recent studies have also shown that inactivation does not dictate drug sensitivity of HERG channels. In the present study, we examined the effect of inactivation gating on cisapride block of HERG. Modulation of HERG inactivation was achieved by either changing extracellular K+ or Cs+ concentrations or by mutations of the channel. We found that although inactivation facilitated cisapride block of the HERG K+ current, it was not coupled with cisapride block of HERG when the Cs+ current was recorded. Furthermore, cisapride block of the HERG K+ current was not linked with inactivation in the mutant HERG channels F656V and F656M.

{"sentence": "RPE65 is essential for the function of cone photoreceptors in NRL-deficient mice.\nPURPOSE: Phototransduction in cones is initiated by the bleaching of their visual pigment, which comprises a protein component-cone opsin-and a vitamin A derivative-11-cis retinal. Little is known about the source of 11-cis retinal for cones. In the current study, neural retina leucine zipper-deficient (Nrl(-/-)) and rod opsin (Rho(-/-))-deficient mice were used, two mouse models that have been described as having a \"cone-only\" retina, to analyze the retinoid metabolism of cones. In addition, these mice were bred to retinal pigment epithelial protein 65 (Rpe65(-/-))-deficient mice to study the role of RPE65. METHODS: Mice were analyzed using morphology, Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, electroretinography (ERG), and retinoid profiling by HPLC. RESULTS: In comparison to wild-type mice, the retina of Nrl(-/-) mice contained elevated levels of RPE65 and cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP), suggesting a particular role of these two proteins for the retinoid metabolism of cones. In Nrl(-/-) mice, different retinoid species were present in proportions similar to wild type. Ablation of RPE65 in Nrl(-/-) and Rho(-/-) mice led to the absence of 11-cis retinal, but increased the total retinoid content, with retinyl esters representing the most abundant retinoid species. In the absence of RPE65, retinal sensitivity in Nrl(-/-) mice dropped by a factor of a thousand. CONCLUSIONS: The data show that RPE65, previously shown to be essential for rod function, is also indispensable for the production of 11-cis retinal for cones and thus for cone function.", "lin_triplets": ""}

However, in spite of their in vitro activity, none of these agents have been shown to be efficacious in vivo against animal models of TB. Described herein are syntheses of new tryptanthrin analogues together with a systematic investigation of their in vitro antitubercular activity and ADME properties followed by pharmacokinetic characterization in rodents for the most promising compounds. Those with the best potency and oral bioavailability were progressed to evaluations of efficacy against acute murine TB. The work aimed to prove the concept that this compound class can limit growth of Mtb during infection as well as to establish the SAR for in vitro activity against Mtb and the range of in vitro ADME parameters for this class of natural products. Novel C-11-deoxy (5b) and A-ring-saturated (6) tryptanthrin analogues were discovered that maintained activity against Mtb and showed improved solubility compared to tryptanthrin as well as evidence of oral bioavailability in rodents. However, neither 5b nor 6 demonstrated efficacy against acute murine TB following administration at doses up to 400 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks.

Rat dams were exposed to 0, 1 and 2mg/kg/day of BDE-99 from gestation day 6 to post-natal day 21. When pups were weaning, cortex and hippocampal gene expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) of the different isoforms of the thyroid hormone (TH) receptors (TRs) were evaluated. Serum TH levels were also determined. The remaining pups were assessed by neurobehavioral testing for learning and memory function. The results showed that maternal transference of BDE-99 produced a delay in the spatial learning task in the water maze test. Moreover, the open-field test revealed a significant dose-response anxiolytic effect. It was also found that the serum levels of triiodothyronine (T3), tetraiiodothyronine (T4) and free-T4 (FT4) decreased. Although no effect on the gene expression of the different isoforms of TRs was observed, the expression of the TH-mediated gene BDNF was down-regulated in the hippocampus.

{"sentence": "Enzyme expression profiles suggest the novel tumor-activated fluoropyrimidine carbamate capecitabine (Xeloda) might be effective against papillary thyroid cancers of children and young adults.\nPURPOSE: The fluoropyrimidine carbamate (capecitabine) is converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by thymidine phosphorylase (TP) inside target tissues. 5-FU interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking thymidylate synthase (TS) but is inactivated by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). Favorable enzyme profiles (high TP and low DPD) generate high intratumor levels of 5-FU that are effective against many tumors, especially those with low TS. Capecitabine has not been tested against thyroid cancers, and it is not known to what extent thyroid cancers express TP, TS or DPD. METHODS: To test this, we determined TP, TS and DPD in 19 thyroid cancers from young patients (14 papillary, 4 follicular, 1 medullary) by immunohistochemistry. After approval by the Human Use Committee, the intensity of TP, TS, and DPD staining was determined by two independent examiners and graded (absent=0 to intense=3) with >90% concordance. RESULTS: TS was detected in 7/19 cancers (37%), TP in 14/19 cancers (74%) and DPD in 14/19 cancers (74%). In six tumors, TP was more intense that DPD, suggesting capecitabine sensitivity. Only five tumors failed to express TP but four of these expressed DPD, suggesting capecitabine resistance. Overall, 6/19 tumors (32% of the total) had a favorable expression profile, and all of them were papillary cancers. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the majority of differentiated thyroid cancers (74%) express TP and low levels of TS (63% undetectable).

Compound C caused G(2)/M cell cycle block, accompanied by apoptotic glioma cell death characterized by caspase activation, phosphatidylserine exposure and DNA fragmentation. The mechanisms underlying the pro-apoptotic action of compound C involved induction of oxidative stress and downregulation of antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2, while no alteration of pro-apoptotic Bax was observed. Compound C diminished AMPK phosphorylation and enzymatic activity, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of its target acetyl CoA carboxylase. AMPK activators metformin and AICAR partly prevented the cell cycle block, oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by compound C. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting of human AMPK mimicked compound C-induced G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, but failed to induce oxidative stress and apoptosis in U251 glioma cells.

{"sentence": "SPIDIA-RNA: first external quality assessment for the pre-analytical phase of blood samples used for RNA based analyses.\nThe diagnostic use of in vitro molecular assays can be limited by the lack of guidelines for collection, handling, stabilization and storage of patient specimens. One of the major goals of the EC funded project SPIDIA (www.spidia.eu) is to develop evidence-based quality guidelines for the pre-analytical phase of blood samples used for molecular testing which requires intracellular RNA analytes. To this end, a survey and a pan-European external quality assessment (EQA) were implemented. This report is the summary of the results of that trial. With the European Federation of Laboratory Medicine (EFLM) support, 124 applications for participation in the trial were received from 27 different European countries, and 102 laboratories actually participated in the trial. Each participating laboratory described their respective laboratory policies and practices as well as blood collection tubes typically used in performing this type of testing. The participating laboratories received two identical blood specimens: in an EDTA tubes (unstabilized blood; n=67) or in tubes designed specifically for the stabilization of intracellular RNA in blood (PAXgene\u00ae Blood RNA tubes; n=35). Laboratories were requested to perform RNA extraction according to the laboratory's own procedure as soon as possible upon receipt of the tubes for one tube and 24h after the first extraction for the second tube. Participants (n=93) returned the two extracted RNAs to SPIDIA facility for analysis, and provided details about the reagents and protocols they used for the extraction. At the SPIDIA facility responsible for coordinating the study, the survey data were classified, and the extracted RNA samples were evaluated for purity, yield, integrity, stability, and the presence of interfering substances affecting RT-qPCR assays. All participants received a report comparing the performance of the RNA they submitted to that of the other participants. All the results obtained by participants for each RNA quality parameter were classified as \"in control\", \"warning\", \"out of control\" and \"missing\" by consensus mean analysis. From the survey data, the most variable parameters were the volume of blood collected and the time and storage temperature between blood collection and RNA extraction. Analyzing the results of quality testing of submitted RNA samples we observed a data distribution of purity, yield, and presence of assay interference in agreement with expected values. The RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values distribution was, on the other hand, much wider than the optimal expected value, which led to an \"in control\" classification, even for partly degraded RNA samples. On the other hand, RIN values below 5 significantly correlated with a reduction of GAPDH expression levels. Furthermore, the distribution of the values of the four transcripts investigated (c-fos, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and GAPDH) was wide and the RNA instability between samples separated by 24h were similar. Assuming the presence of at least two quality parameters \"out of control\" as an indication of a critical performance of the laboratory, 33% of the laboratories were included in this group. The results of this study will be the basis for implementing a second pan-European EQA and the results of both EQAs will be pooled and will provide the basis for the implementation of evidence-based guidelines for the pre-analytical phase of RNA analysis of blood samples.", "lin_triplets": ""}

{"sentence": "Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of phospho-AKT dynamics by the ubiquitin E3 ligase, NEDD4-1, in the insulin-like growth factor-1 response.\nAKT is a critical effector kinase downstream of the PI3K pathway that regulates a plethora of cellular processes including cell growth, death, differentiation, and migration. Mechanisms underlying activated phospho-AKT (pAKT) translocation to its action sites remain unclear. Here we show that NEDD4-1 is a novel E3 ligase that specifically regulates ubiquitin-dependent trafficking of pAKT in insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling. NEDD4-1 physically interacts with AKT and promotes HECT domain-dependent ubiquitination of exogenous and endogenous AKT. NEDD4-1 catalyzes K63-type polyubiquitin chain formation on AKT in vitro. Plasma membrane binding is the key step for AKT ubiquitination by NEDD4-1 in vivo. Ubiquitinated pAKT translocates to perinuclear regions, where it is released into the cytoplasm, imported into the nucleus, or coupled with proteasomal degradation. IGF-1 signaling specifically stimulates NEDD4-1-mediated ubiquitination of pAKT, without altering total AKT ubiquitination. A cancer-derived plasma membrane-philic mutant AKT(E17K) is more effectively ubiquitinated by NEDD4-1 and more efficiently trafficked into the nucleus compared with wild type AKT.

The present study presented an evidence for the cell cycle-targeting activity of SB in a panel of p53-mutant human cancer cell lines of different origin, and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. A combination of cell cycle analysis, immunocytometry, immunoblotting, and RNA interference revealed that SB induced a BubR1-dependent mitotic arrest. Mechanistically, SB was shown to possess a microtubule destabilizing activity evidenced by hyperphosphorylation of Bcl2 and BclxL, suppression of microtubule polymerization and induction of a prometaphase arrest. Molecular docking studies suggested that SB has a good affinity towards vinblastine-binding site on \u03b2-tubulin subunit. Of note, SB265610 which is a close structural analogue of SB225002 with a potent IL-8RB antagonistic activity did not exhibit a similar antimitotic activity. Importantly, in P-glycoprotein overexpressing NCI/Adr-Res cells the antitumor activity of SB was unaffected by multidrug resistance. Interestingly, the mechanisms of SB-induced cell death were cell-line dependent, where in invasive hepatocellular carcinoma HLE cells the significant contribution of BAK-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis was demonstrated. Conversely, SB activated p38 MAPK signaling in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells SW480, and pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAPK activity revealed its key role in mediating SB-induced caspase-independent cell death.

The protective actions of intravenously (i.v.) administered pyridostigmine, physostigmine, eptastigmine, and an organophosphate hydrolase, phosphotriesterase, in acute sarin intoxication were studied in mice. The acute intragastric (i.g.) toxicity (LD50) of sarin with and without the pretreatments was tested by the up-and-down method. The mice received pyridostigmine (0.06 mg/kg body weight), physostigmine (0.09 mg/kg body weight), the physostigmine derivative eptastigmine (0.90 mg/kg body weight) or phosphotriesterase (104 U/g, 10.7 microg/g body weight) 10 min prior to the i.g. administration of sarin. Physostigmine was also administered with phosphotriesterase. Phosphotriesterase was the most effective antidote in sarin intoxication. The LD50 value for sarin increased 3.4-fold in mice receiving phosphotriesterase. Physostigmine was the most effective carbamate in sarin exposure. The protective ratios of physostigmine and pyridostigmine were 1.5- and 1.2-1.3-fold, respectively. Eptastigmine did not give any protection against sarin toxicity. Both the phosphotriesterase and physostigmine treatments protected the brain AChE activities measured 24 h after sarin exposure. In phosphotriesterase and physostigmine-treated mice, a 4- and 2-fold higher sarin dose, respectively, was needed to cause a 50% inhibition of brain AChE activity. Moreover, the combination of phosphotriesterase-physostigmine increased the LD50 value for sarin 4.3-fold. The animals pretreated with phosphotriesterase-ephysostigmine tolerated four times the lethal dose in control animals, furthermore their survival time was 2-3 h in comparison to 20 min in controls.

{"sentence": "Sexually dimorphic behavior after developmental exposure to characterize endocrine-mediated effects of different non-dioxin-like PCBs in rats.\nMany chemicals are known to exhibit endocrine activity and affect reproductive functions in vertebrates and invertebrates. Endocrine effects include influences on sexual differentiation of the brain during development and reproductive and non-reproductive behavior in adult offspring. We previously demonstrated that developmental exposure to a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which was reconstituted according to the congener pattern found in human breast milk caused feminization of sweet preference as a sexually dimorphic behavior in adult male rats, following decreases in aromatase activity in the brain of newborn male pups. This result may be due to dioxin-like or non-dioxin-like (NDL) PCBs and their respective effects on steroid hormones. The aim of the present experiments was to determine if exposure to highly purified NDL-PCBs (to remove Ah receptor active contaminants) also results in alteration of sweet preference. Pregnant rats were orally exposed to PCB52 (6 dose groups, total dose of 0-3000mg/kg body weight) or PCB180 (6 dose groups, total dose of 0-1000mg/kg body weight). In a further experiment rat dams were treated with equimolar doses of PCB74 or PCB95 (total dose, 760\u03bcmol/kg body weight, corresponding to 229mg/kg or 248mg/kg body weight of PCB74 and PCB95, respectively). Adult male and female offspring were given a choice between a bottle of saccharin solution (0.25%) and a bottle of tap water on five consecutive days. Control females consumed approximately twice as much sweetened solution compared with control males, thus, demonstrating sexual dimorphism of this behavior. Only non-significant reduction of sweet preference was found at the top dose level in female offspring after exposure to PCB52. Female offspring exposed to PCB180 exhibited signs of supernormal behavior as illustrated by increased saccharin consumption at intermediate dose levels. Decreased sweet preference was observed in females after developmental PCB74, whereas males were unaffected. Only PCB95 increased saccharin consumption in exposed males, leading to decreased sexual dimorphism of this behavior and behavioral feminization. The results demonstrate that different NDL-PCBs exhibit differential effects on sexually dimorphic behavior and that feminization occurs after removal of Ah receptor active contaminants.

However, both mixtures contain substantial concentrations of PCB and DDT suggesting these contaminants as the predominant contributors to the toxicity observed. The observed effects included phenotypic traits, like embryo production and survival, and gene transcription changes corresponding with disease and biological functions such as cancer, reproductive system disease, cardiovascular disease, lipid and protein metabolism, small molecule biochemistry and cell cycle. The changes in gene transcription included genes regulated by HNF4A, insulin, LH, FSH and NF-\u03baB which are known to be central regulators of endocrine signaling, metabolism, metabolic homeostasis, immune functions, cancer development and reproduction. The results suggest that relative low concentrations of the natural mixtures of POPs used in the present study might pose a threat to wild freshwater fish living in the lakes from which the POPs mixtures originated.", "lin_triplets": ""}
{"sentence": "A New Proposed Rodent Model of Chemically Induced Prostate Carcinogenesis: Distinct Time-Course Prostate Cancer Progression in the Dorsolateral and Ventral Lobes.\nBACKGROUND: Characterization of novel rodent models for prostate cancer studies requires evaluation of either spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumors as well as tumor incidence in different prostatic lobes. We propose a new short-term rodent model of chemically induced prostate carcinogenesis in which prostate cancer progression occurs differentially in the dorsolateral and ventral lobes. METHODS: Adult gerbils were treated with MNU alone or associated with testosterone for 3 or 6 months of treatment. Tumor incidence, latency, localization, and immunohistochemistry (AR, PCNA, smooth muscle \u03b1-actin, p63, MGMT, and E-cadherin) were studied in both lobes. RESULTS: Comparisons between both lobes revealed that lesions developed first in the DL while the VL presented longer tumor latency. However, after 6 months, there was a dramatic increase in tumor multiplicity in the VL, mainly in MNU-treated groups. Lesions clearly progressed from a premalignant to a malignant phenotype over time and tumor latency was decreased by MNU\u2009+\u2009testosterone administration. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the prostatic complex showed that the DL developed tumors exclusively in the periurethral area and showed intense AR, PCNA, and MGMT immunostaining. Moreover, VL lesions emerged throughout the entire lobe. MNU-induced lesions presented markers indicative of an aggressive phenotype: lack of basal cells, rupture of the smooth muscle cell layer, loss of E-cadherin, and high MGMT staining. CONCLUSIONS: There are distinct pathways involved in tumor progression in gerbil prostate lobes. This animal provides a good model for prostate cancer since it allows the investigation of advanced steps of carcinogenesis with shorter latency periods in both lobes.
